# Diabetes Management App – Congressional App Challenge 2025

**Overview**
This project is Aaron’s submission for the 2025 Congressional App Challenge. It’s a diabetes management app designed to help people with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) monitor blood glucose patterns, receive personalized insights, and improve daily decision-making.
Inspired by Aaron’s own journey with T1D and his advocacy work with Breakthrough T1D, the app aims to empower users—especially teens—to live more confidently and safely.

**Motivation**
Managing T1D requires constant attention to blood glucose levels, insulin dosing, meals, exercise, and stress. Many teens feel overwhelmed, especially when transitioning to greater independence.
Aaron combined his passion for coding with his personal experience to create a tool that:
Integrates with existing platforms (like Nightscout)
Analyzes glucose data to identify patterns
Sends gentle reminders or insights for better diabetes management
Helps kids and families feel less alone and more in control

**Features**
* Connect to continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data
* Display blood glucose trends with clear visuals
* Identifies patterns and provide personalized suggestions based on historical data
* Alert users to potential highs/lows based on trends
* Share summary reports with parents or healthcare teams
* Create community of t1d teenagers

**Technologies Used**
***Frontend***: HTML / CSS
***Backend: *** Node.js / JavaScript
**APIs: ** Nightscout API
